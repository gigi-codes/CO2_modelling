### UPDATE: May 1, 2022
LA TIMES Op-Ed: <a href = https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-05-01/inland-empire-warehouse-growth-map-environment>We mapped the warehouse takeover of the Inland Empire</a> by <a href = "https://www.pitzer.edu/academics/faculty/susan-phillips/"> Dr. Susan Phillips (professor of Enviornmental Analysis)</a>, on the team's work at the <a href = https://www.pitzer.edu/redfordconservancy/> Robert Redford Conservancy for Southern California Sustainability at Pitzer College</a>. 

Images for presentation slides mapping increase of warehousees are screencaps from this <a href = https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/g.x6767/viz/CES_1_4/Dashboard1> tableau</a> (completed to visualize the changes in density) complement the ongoing work of researchers in the Inland Empire.

SUMMARY
---
We aggregated data from `4` <a href = "https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/about-calenviroscreen">CA OEHHA CalEnviro Screen</a> reports, appended warehouse counts extracted from <a href = "link"> US Census Business Data</a> and trained numerous estimators, however none reliably modelled health outcomes using the aggregated data.

## Background 
California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (<a href = "https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/about-calenviroscreen">CA OEHHA</a>) has compiled data from various government agencies to create a mapping tool used to identifying communities most affected by various pollution sources, producing four reports total in years 2013, 2014, 2018 and 2021 with scores to for each identified disadvantaged community that was disproportionally facing enviornmental impacts. Because trasportation of goods and people continues to be the primary source of emissions, and because increased commerce requires increased warehousing and associated transportation, we sought to create models to answer the following questoins: 

* Is effect of increased warehouse presence on health outcomes quantifiable ?
* What are primary mitigating factors the State can address in response to increased warehouse density?
* How well do the CalEnviroScreen scores reflect emergency healthcare counts?
* What indicators from the CalEnviroScreen dataset best determine the number of emergency healthcare visits?

## _Target_

We trained multiple estimators to model the outcomes reported in the _CalEnviroScreen_ reports to build upon that work: 

variable name   | type      | description 
---             | ---       | ---

low birth weight| numeric   | % newborns weighing `< 2.5 kg` (#/100 live births)

## _Exploratory Data Analyses_ 

* outliers in features were not dropped: as the data from the report is meticulously collected and averaged, eliminating observations outside of some central-tendency would eliminate communities that are most affected by selected factors.

## _Modeling_

> ### David: Linear Models
The linear models give us a sense of which of the features to focus on if we want to address these health issues.

large coefficients ---(relative to that feature scale. Divide these by corresponding feature stds or scale data ahead of time for direct comparison of importance. not as fancy as PCR or other importance techniques)---
large coefficients on high R^2 models indicate features to work on if we wish to reduce ER visits for these three health types.

* warehouses alone are very poor indicators.
* socio-economi metrcs not as good as the caes modified scores (which also account for social and pollution), but some relationship here.

CAES scores alone (train/test)
the caes scores are decent.

* lbw (0.23950857499514167, 0.2515350979968135)
* cvd (0.2364798467342505, 0.23122365100217368)
* comparing these, as well as with correlations alone, gives a sense of the importance of the social features.

> ### Giovanna: Random Forest & SVR 
<br> 

`Random Forest Regression` over a Gridsearch to find optimal values returned the following importances and low-performance scores, indicating that the metrics we used to model health outcomes are insufficient, and highlighting that socioeconomic factors are much more predictive. Specifically, the number of warehouses in a given zip code does not reflect the outcomes in that zip code.

## _Conclusion_
We saw saw no meaningful relationship to create robust models for health outcomes using our warehouse-aggregated data for any models we tried to fit. _Cal EnviroScreen_ scores highly reflect `asthma` and `pollution burden` but not `hospitalization rates`. Socioeconomic factors aggregated in _Cal EnviroScreen_ built best predictive models for negative health outcomes, highlighting the need for the State to address root causes for pollution burden. 

---
## _Next Steps_
We will continue to aggregate more data with finer granularity, and explore the raw data from which the CalEnviroScreen was sourced and modeled. Furthemore, spatial and temporal analyses will provide more robust models for projecting and adddressing communites to support.
